# Pre – Interview Programming Task
## Task Duration:	
We understand your time is valuable, please don’t spend more than 2-3 hours on this task.

## Purpose & Objective:  
A significant portion of the technical interview will be a code review of your submission.

We are looking for a production quality design that is in your opinion, elegant, extensible and maintainable.

We would rather see half the job done well with a good clean code design.

**The task definition is intentionally a bit vague, if you are uncertain about anything, make some sensible assumptions. Submit any assumptions you make with your response.**

## The Task:
A skeleton (non-functional) web application based on .net core web-api and Vue.js is provided. 
Enhance the application to achieve these following requirements: 
* Produce a warning if names are less than four characters
* Produce an error if the code denoting the state is not in the “states_table”
* Produce a warning if the salary is not a positive integer
* Produce an error if no post code exists
* Produce a warning if the postcode is not valid for the state

**Notes**
* The csv validation should take place on the server side.
* Get data for the result table from the server side.
* Show your results in a tabular format considering the result might be large.
* Ensure the application follows best security practices.
* Ensure proper browser caching is achieved.

**Bonus**
* Make the UI generally more pretty, functional & user friendly (perhaps output grouping / filtering)
